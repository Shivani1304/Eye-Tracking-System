# Eye-Tracking-System
Keep shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat along with your python files project.py and tic-tac-toe.py in python directory.

▪ Pre-install required modules such as dlib, NumPy, imutils, Tkinter, OpenCV and PyAutoGUI.

▪ Firstly, run the python file named as tic-tac-toe.py to open the game and keep the game window on one side.

▪ For that, change the current directory to the location where the python files are present. Then, run the program using command: ‘python tic-tac-toe.py’.

▪ Again, run the project.py file in command prompt using syntax: ‘python project.py’.

▪ Thus, other window will get open with web-cam activation to run the eye-tracking functionality.

▪ It detects the eyes and its movements to cover desired functionalities such as; blinking eye would activate mouse-cursor motion, right-eye wink would work as right click and left-eye wink would work as left-click of the mouse.

▪ Using these functionalities, we can move the cursor and play Tic-Tac-Toe game.

▪ Also, we can operate desktop, open files and do other things which a mouse-pointer does by simply running ‘project.py’ file.
